== PROJECT: TeaPet

---

== Overview

TeaPet is a personal manager application for Form Teachers of Primary, Secondary and Tertiary institutions. The user interacts with it via
a Command Line Interface (CLI) along with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. The application is
written in Java.


== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: developed the *Personal Schedule* feature of TeaPet.
** *What it does*: Allows the user to keep track of all of his/her events by adding it as an Event in the Personal Schedule.
** *Justification*: This feature ensures our product to be an integrated platform that allows users
 to track events that they have to attend. We decided to integrate this feature into TeaPet because we feel that TeaPet should also be an application
that helps the user manage their time, on top of its primary functions of managing the user's class details. An integrated platform will ensure that our
product will help the user save time by only using TeaPet, since using different applications to keep track of different things is a hassle.
** *Highlights*: Users are able to add, edit and delete events scheduled in their personal scheduler. They can set recurring events and have different
color codes to represent different event types. Users can export their schedule to an .ics file to import into Google Calendar and other mainstream calendar applications.
Different view modes are also available for the Personal Schedule. The implementation was challenging as it required me to study the implementation of the library.
** *Credits*:
*** JFXtras iCalendar API was used to help develop our Personal Schedule.
*** Levenshtein distance formula was used to help us decide the similarity of event names that helped us built a recommendation system.

* *Minor enhancements*:
** Ensured code naming is coherent within the project.
** Ensured product looks coherent by removing AddressBook code in documents.
* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=garysyndromes&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-02-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false[Functional and Test code]]
