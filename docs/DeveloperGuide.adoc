== Introduction

Welcome to TeaPet!

image::Ui.png[width="790"]

TeaPet is an integrated platform fully customized for Form Teachers in Primary, Secondary and Tertiary institutions to help them manage their classroom effectively.
It contains their personal curriculum schedule, students' particulars, and can also track their class' academic progress.

All their important information is comfortably compartmentalized on our simple and clean Graphical User Interface (GUI) and we are optimized for users who are very comfortable
working on the Command Line Interface (CLI).

If you are looking for a way to easily manage your administrative classroom chores
and have quick hands, then TeaPet is definitely for you!

== About
The aim of this Developer Guide is to provide an introduction to the software architecture and implementation of TeaPet.
It is made for developers who wish to understand and maintain the backbone of our application.

At TeaPet, we prioritise teamwork. We welcome you developers to contribute and improve on our application anytime by
opening an issue should you have any refreshing ideas to improve TeaPet after reading this guide.

== How To Use
This section will teach you how should you go about understanding our Developer Guide in order to best understand our product.

Reading ahead, you will find that we've adopted the "top-down" approach into the structure of our Developer Guide --
We will first look at the high-level architecture of our application before delving into the implementation details of each feature that makes up TeaPet.

We encourage you to read every page diligently from the top to the bottom in order to get the highest level of understanding of our application.
If you are only interested in how we develop one feature, you may read the high-level design then focus on the implementation of that particular feature.

This section provides you with the tools needed for you to set up TeaPet.

You can refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design


[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture
This section describes the high-level software architecture of TeaPet.

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-2/main/tree/master/docs/diagrams[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name} Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `{Entity Name} student delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `student delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component
This section describes the high-level software structure of TeaPet's UI Component.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `NotesPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` and `HelpWindow`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-2/main/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component
This section describes the high-level software structure of TeaPet's Logic Component.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `TeaPetParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a student).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`,and then displayed to the user.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `UI` to perform certain actions.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("student delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `student delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `StudentCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

This section describes the high-level software structure of TeaPet's Model Component.

.Structure of the Model Component with `Student` class as a detailed example.
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the data of different Entities.
* stores in-memory data of Students, Admin, Academics, Notes and Events.
* exposes multiple unmodifiable `ObservableLists` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.



[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component
This section describes the high-level software structure of TeaPet's Storage Component.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* converts Model objects into savable data in JSON-format and vice versa.
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can store `Students`, `Admin`, `Academics`, `Notes` and `Events` in a several json files, which can be read.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.
//end::design-doc[]


== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//@@author TheElectricBlender
//tag::particulars-feature[]
=== Student particulars feature
The student particulars feature keeps track of essential student details.
The feature comprises of commands namely,

* `StudentAddCommand` - Adds the student particulars into the class list
* `StudentEditCommand` - Edits the particulars of a student
* `StudentDeleteCommand` - Deletes the student information
* `StudentFindCommand` - Finds information of the required student
* `StudentClearCommand` - Deletes all student details from the student list


The student commands all share similar paths of execution and is illustrated in the following sequence diagram below,
which shows the sequence diagram for the StudentAddCommand.

The commands when executed, will interface with the methods exposed by the `Model` interface to perform the related operations
(See <<Design-Logic,logic component>> for the general overview).

.Sequence Diagram for StudentAddCommand
image::StudentAddSequence.png[]

{nbsp} +

*These are the common steps among the Student Commands:*

1. The `TeaPetParser` will assign the `StudentCommandParser` to parse the user input.

2. The `StudentCommandParser#parse` will take in a string of user input consisting of the arguments.

3. The arguments are tokenized and the respective models of each argument are created.



[[Feature-Add]]
==== Student Add command

===== Implementation

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `StudentAddCommand` performs.

1. After the successful parsing of user input, the `StudentAddCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called which validates the student defined.


2. As student names are unique, if a duplicate student is defined, a `CommandException` is thrown which will not add the defined student.

3. The method `Model#addStudent(Student student)` will then be called to add the student. The command box will be reflected with
the `StudentAddCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the success message.
[NOTE]
If the format or wording of adding a student contains error(s), the behaviour of TeaPet will be that
either a unknown command or wrong format error message will be displayed.

4. The newly created student is added to the `UniqueStudentList`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `student add` command:

.Activity Diagram for StudentAddCommand
image::StudentAddActivityDiagram.png[]


==== Student Edit command

===== Implementation

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `StudentEditCommand` performs.

1. After the successful parsing of user input, the `StudentEditCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called which checks
if the `Index` is defined as an argument when instantiating the `StudentEditCommand(Index, index, EditStudentDescriptor editStudentDescriptor)`
constructor. It uses the `StudentEditCommand.EditStudentDescriptor` to create a new edited student.


2. A new `Student` with the newly updated values will be created which replaces the existing `Student` object using the
`Model#setStudent(Student target, Student editedStudent)` method.

3. The filtered student list is then updated with the new `Student` with the `Model#updateFilteredStudentList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_STUDENTS)` method.

4. The command box will be reflected with the `StudentEditCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new `CommandResult` will be
returned with the success message.

==== Student Delete command

===== Implementation

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `StudentDeleteCommand` performs.

1. After the successful parsing of user input, the `StudentDeleteCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called which checks if the `Index`
is defined as an argument when instantiating the `StudentDeleteCommand(Index index)`  constructor. +
[NOTE]
The `Index` must be within the bounds of the student list. +

2. The `Student` at the specified `Index` is then removed from the `UniqueStudentList#students` observable list using the
`Model#deleteStudent(Index index)` method.

3. The command box will be reflected with the `StudentDeleteCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new `CommandResult` will
be returned with the success message.

==== Student Find command

===== Implementation

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `StudentFindCommand` performs.

1. After the successful parsing of user input, the `StudentFindCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called which checks if the
`NameContainsKeywordsPredicate(keywords)` is defined as part of the argument when instantiating the
`StudentFindCommand(NameContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` constructor.

2. The `Student` is then searched through the `UniqueStudentList#students` list using the `Model#hasStudent(Student student)` method
to check if the `Student` already exists. If the `Student` does not exist, a `StudentNotFoundException` will be thrown and the `Student` will not be displayed.

3. The existing `UniqueStudentList#internalList` is then cleared and updated using the `Model#updateFilteredStudentList(Predicate predicate)`
method.

4. A new `CommandResult` will be returned with the success message.

==== Student Clear command

===== Implementation

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `StudentFindCommand` performs.

1. After the successful parsing of the user input, the `StudentClearCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

2. The `Model#setTeaPet(ReadOnlyTeaPet teaPet)` method is then called which triggers the `TeaPet#resetData(ReadOnlyTeaPet newData)` method
and creates a brand new student list to replace the old one.

3. A new `CommandResult` will be returned with the success message.

===== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Command Syntax
* *Current Implementation:*

** Current implementation of the feature follows just the command word syntax
For example, `student`.

* *Alternatives Considered:*
** We considered using the forward slash `/` before the command word, for example `/add`. However, we realise that it is redundant
and will make inputs more tedious and confusing for users.



===== Aspect: Command Length:
* *Current Implementation:*
** Commands are shortened as much as possible without much loss in clarity. For example, instead of using `/temperature`, we used
`/temp` instead to input the students temperature into the application. Although this may be initially unfamiliar to users, it
should be easy to pick up and make it less tedious during input.

* *Alternatives Considered:*
** We considered using more descriptive arguments such that arguments are clear and succinct. However, this will definitely decrease
the user expereince as the command will be too long to type.


==== Import image feature

This feature was included in TeaPet to help teachers easily identify the students using their pictures instead of just names.
This feature utilises the `StudentCard#updateImage` method to update the images of students.


The feature comprises of one command namely, `DefaultStudentDisplayCommand`

* Updates the student list to show updated images of students and displays the student list.


This is further illustrated in the following sequence diagram below.


.Sequence Diagram for `DefaultStudentDisplayCommand`
image::ImportImage.v1.png[]

===== Implementation

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `DefaultStudentDisplayCommand` performs.

1. After the successful parsing of user input, the `DefaultStudentDisplayCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called. It does not
require validation as it does not write into the student list.

2. The `StudentCardDefault#updateImage` method is then called which checks the image folder for the required png file and updates
the student card.
[NOTE]
The name of the png file must match the name of the student.

3. If any view other than the student list view is showing on the `MainWindow`, the `MainWindow#handleDefaultStudent()` method
will be called and the student list is now visible on the `MainWindow`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `student` command:


.Activity Diagram Import Image Feature
image::ImportImageSequenceDiagram.png[]

{nbsp} +

===== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Command Syntax
* *Current Implementation:*

** Current implementation of the commands follows the command word syntax, followed by the arguments necessary for execution.
For example, `student add/edit/delete/find`.

* *Alternatives Considered:*
** We considered using a whole new command, `student refresh` to solely refresh and update images of the students. However, we realised
that it would be more convenient for the user if we just add this functionality into the `student` command instead as it is able to
both update the images and display the student list concurrently.

==== Class Overview
The class diagram below depicts the structure of the Admin Model Component.

.Class Diagram for Admin Model
image::admin/AdminModelClassDiagram.png[]

==== Admin Display Command

===== Implementation

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `AdminDisplayCommand` performs.

*Step 1*. The `AdminDisplayCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which does not take in any arguments.

*Step 2*. The method `Model#updateFilteredStudentList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_STUDENTS)` will then be called to update the
filtered student list to show all current students in the student list.


[NOTE]
If the class list is empty, a blank page will be shown.

*Step 3*. The command box will be reflected with the `AdminDisplayCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new
`CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

[NOTE]
If the wording of the `AdminDisplayCommand` contains error(s), an unknown command message will be displayed.

==== Admin Dates Command

===== Implementation

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `AdminSaveCommand` performs.

*Step 1*. The `AdminDatesCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which does not take in any arguments.

*Step 2*. The method `Model#updateFilteredDateList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_DATES)` will then be called to update the
filtered date list to show all current dates in the date list.

[NOTE]
If the date list is empty, a blank page will be shown.

*Step 3*. The command box will be reflected with the `AdminDatesCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new
`CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

[NOTE]
If the format or wording of the `AdminDatesCommand` command contains error(s), an unknown command or a wrong format message
will be displayed.

==== Admin Save Command

===== Implementation
The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `AdminSaveCommand` performs.

*Step 1*. The `AdminSaveCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which takes in today's date as an argument.

*Step 2*. The method `Model#updateFilteredStudentList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_STUDENTS)` will then be called to update the
filtered student list to show all current students in the student list.

*Step 3*. Sequentially, a date constructor will then called, creating a date object with today's date and
`Model#getFilteredStudentList()`

*Step 4*. The method `Model#addDate(Date date)` will then be called to add the date. This will then trigger the
`UniqueDateList#addDate(Date toadd)` method, which will throw `DuplicateDateException` if the date that is been added
exists, with the duplicate dates error message.

*Step 5*. The command box will be reflected with the `AdminSaveCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new
`CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

[NOTE]
If the format or wording of `AdminSaveCommand` contains error(s), an unknown command or wrong format error message will be
displayed.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes AdminSaveCommand:

.Activity Diagram for AdminSaveCommand
image::admin/AdminSaveActivityDiagram.png[]

===== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Which date to save

* **Current Implementation:** Saves the most updated administrative list as today's date.
** Pros: Easy to implement and prevents mutation of dates.
** Cons: The user will be unable to overwrite dates.

* **Alternatives Considered:** Saves the most updated administrative list as any date.
** Pros: The user can mutate any dates as he or she wishes.
** Cons: Hard to implement, and possible accidental mutation of dates.

====== Aspect: Allow overwriting of data

* **Current Implementation:** Saving a date that exists in the storage is not allowed.
** Pros: Easy to implement and prevent accidental mutation of data
** Cons: Hard to implement.

* **Alternatives Considered:** Saving a date that exists in the storage is allowed.
** Pros: User can make necessary changes to the dates where errors exists.
** Cons: Hard to implement and could result in accidental mutation of dates.

==== Admin Delete Command

===== Implementation
The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `admin save` performs.

*Step 1*. The `AdminDeleteCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which takes in a
DateContainsKeywordsPredicate object as an argument. User input will be parsed first to a DateContainsKeywordsPredicate
object before passing to the`AdminDeleteCommand` constructor.
[NOTE]
Date is to be entered in YYYY-MM-DD format, or a ParseException will be thrown and an error message will be displayed.

*Step 2*. The method `Model#updateFilteredStudentList(DateContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` will then be called to
update the filtered date list to show the date that matches the given predicate. If no such date is found after
searching through the `UniqueDateList#dates`, a DateNotFoundException will be thrown with an error message displayed.

*Step 3.* After the date has been found, the method `Model*deleteDate(Date target)` will then be called to remove the
specified date from `UniqueDateList`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:

.Admin Delete Sequence Diagram
image::admin/AdminDeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Admin Fetch Command

*Step 1*. The `AdminFetchCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which takes in a
DateContainsKeywordsPredicate object as an argument. User input will be parsed first to a DateContainsKeywordsPredicate
object before passing to the`AdminFetchCommand` constructor.
[NOTE]
Date is to be entered in YYYY-MM-DD format, or a ParseException will be thrown and an error message will be displayed.

*Step 2*. The method `Model#updateFilteredStudentList(DateContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` will then be called to
update the filtered date list to show the date that matches the given predicate. If no such date is found after
searching through the `UniqueDateList#dates`, a DateNotFoundException will be thrown with an error message displayed.

[NOTE]
The sequence diagram for `admin fetch` command is similar to that of `admin delete` command.

=== Student Academics feature
This student academics feature stores and tracks the class' academics progress.

The academics feature consists of the following commands namely,

* `AcademicsCommand` - Displays the most updated student academics details.
* `AcademicsAddCommand` - Adds a new assessment to the academic list.
* `AcademicsEditCommand` - Edits the details of a particular assessment.
* `AcademicsDeleteCommand` - Deletes the specified assessment from academics.
* `AcademicsSubmitCommand` - Submits students' work to the specified assessment.
* `AcademicsMarkCommand` - Marks students' work of the specified assessment.
* `AcademicsDisplayCommand` - Displays either homework, exam, or the report of student academics.
* `AcademicsExportCommand` - Exports the academics information into a .csv file.

All academics commands share similar paths of execution. The commands when executed, will interface with the methods
exposed by the `Model` interface to perform the related operations (See <<Design-Logic,logic component>> for the general overview).

==== Class Overview
The class diagram below will depict the structure of the Academics Model Component.

.Class Diagram for Academics Model
image::academics/AcademicsModelClassDiagram.png[]

==== Academics Add Command

===== Implementation
The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `AcademicsAddCommand` performs.

*Step 1*. The `AcademicsAddCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which takes in a necessary assessment
description, type and date.
[NOTE]
Format for adding an assessment is `academics add desc/ASSESSMENT_DESCRIPTION type/TYPE date/DATE`.

*Step 2*. As assessment names should be unique, the `Model#hasAssessment(Assessment assessment)` method will check if
the assessment already exists in `UniqueAssessmentList#assessments`. If a duplicate assessment is found, a
`CommandException` will be thrown.

*Step 3*. Subsequently, the `Model#getFilteredStudentList()` method will then be called, to set the student submission
tracker for the assessment.

*Step 4*. The method `Model#addAssessment(Assessment assessment)` will then be called to add the assessment. The
command box will be reflected with the `AcademicsAddCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new `CommandResult` will be
returned with the message.

[NOTE]
If the format or wording of `AcademicsAddCommand` contains error(s), an unknown command or wrong format error message
will be displayed.

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an AcademicsAddCommand:

.Academics Add Command Sequence Diagram
image::academics/academics_add_command_sequence_diagram.png[]

==== Academics Edit Command

===== Implementation
The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `AcademicsEditCommand` performs.

*Step 1*. The `AcademicsEditCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which edits the details of the specified
assessment. The method checks if the `index` defined when instantiating
`AcademicsEditCommand(Index index, EditAssessmentDescriptor editAssessmentDescriptor)` is valid. Since it is optional
for users to input fields, the fields not entered will reuse the existing values that are currently stored and defined
in the `Assessment` object.
[NOTE]
User needs to input at least 1 field of assessment to edit.

*Step 2*. A new `Assessment` with the newly updated values will be created which replaces the existing `Assessment`
object using the `Model#setAssessment(Assessment target, Assessment editedAssessment)` method. However, if new
assessment results in a duplicate assessment in `UniqueAssessmentList#assessments`, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

*Step 4*. The command box will be reflected with the `AcademicsEditCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new
`CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

==== Academics Delete Command

===== Implementation
The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `AcademicsDeleteCommand` performs.

*Step 1*. The `AcademicsDeleteCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which deletes the assessment at the
specified index. It checks if the `Index` is defined as an argument when instantiating the `AcademicsDeleteCommand`
constructor.
[NOTE]
The `Index` must be within the bounds of `UniqueAssessmentList#assessments`.

*Step 2*. The `Assessment` at the specified `Index` is then removed from `UniqueAssessmentList#assessments` observable
list using the `Model#delete(Assessment assessment)` method.

*Step 3.* The command box will be reflected with the `AcademicsDeleteCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new
`CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

==== Academics Submit Command

===== Implementation
The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `AcademicsSubmitCommand` performs.

*Step 1*. The `AcademicsSubmitCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which submits students' work for the
assessment at the specified index. The method checks if the `Index` is defined as an argument when instantiating the
`AcademicsSubmitCommand` constructor.
[NOTE]
The `Index` must be within the bounds of `UniqueAssessmentList#assessments`.

*Step 2*. Subsequently, the `Model#hasStudentName(String studentName)` method will then check if the given student
exists in `UniqueStudentList#students`. Also, `Model#hasStudentSubmitted(String studentName)` method checks if the
student has already submitted their work for the specified assessment. If the student does not exist or has already
submitted their work, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

*Step 3*. The students' `Submission` will then be submitted to the specified `Assessment` using the method
`Model#submitAssessment(Assessment assessment, List<String> students)`.

*Step 4.* The command box will be reflected with the `AcademicsSubmitCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new
`CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an AcademicsSubmitCommand:

.Academics Submit Activity Diagram
image::academics/AcademicsSubmitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Academics Mark Command

===== Implementation
The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `AcademicsMarkCommand` performs.

*Step 1*. The `AcademicsMarkCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which marks students' work and stores the
students' scores for the assessment at the specified index. The method checks if the `Index` is defined as an argument
when instantiating the `AcademicsMarkCommand` constructor.
[NOTE]
The `Index` must be within the bounds of `UniqueAssessmentList#assessments`.

*Step 2*. Subsequently, the `Model#hasStudentName(String studentName)` method will then check if the given student
exists in `UniqueStudentList#students`. Also, `Model#hasStudentSubmitted(String studentName)` method checks if the
student has yet to submit their work for the specified assessment. If the student does not exist or has not submitted
their work, a `CommandException` will be thrown. Furthermore, the score should be between 0 and 100 inclusive,
otherwise `CommandException` will also be thrown.
[NOTE]
Format for marking a students' work is `academics mark INDEX stu/STUDENT_NAME-SCORE`.

*Step 3*. The students' `Submission` will then be marked and its score will be stored in the specified `Assessment`
using the method `Model#markAssessment(Assessment assessment, List<String> students)`.

*Step 4.* The command box will be reflected with the `AcademicsMarkCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new
`CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

===== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Allow submission along with marking

* **Current Implementation:** Marking a submission that has not be submitted is not allowed.
** Pros: Clearer and prevents confusion in data.
** Cons: Harder to implement and the user will have to submit students' work separately.

* **Alternatives Considered:** Marking an unsubmitted work will also submit it for the assessment.
** Pros: The user can just submit students work using the mark command, giving them less to type.
** Cons: Prone to confusion of submitting and marking commands.

===== Aspect: Allow customizable total score of assessments

* **Current Implementation: ** Setting the total score for a submission is not allowed. (Total score for all submissions will be 100.)
** Pros: Easy to implement and maintains uniformity of data.
** Cons: User cannot set different total scores for assessments and have to grade it to a 100 weightage.

* **Alternatives Considered:** Setting the total score for a submission is allowed.
** Pros: User can make set different total scores to different assessments according to its requirements.
** Cons: Hard to implement and could result in inconsistency of data.

==== Academics Display Command

===== Implementation

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `AcademicsDisplayCommand` performs.

*Step 1*. The `AcademicsDisplayCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which can either take in no arguments
or a 1 word argument indicating the type of display to show.

[NOTE]
Other than the default display (no arguments needed), there are only 3 types of displays: `homework`, `exam`, and
`report`. +
Format: `academics` or `academics DISPLAY_TYPE`

*Step 2*. Depending on the display type, the command box will reflect its respective `AcademicsDisplayCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS`
constant and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the message. +
Example. `homework` type display will reflect `AcademicsDisplayCommand#MESSAGE_HOMEWORK_SUCCESS`

[NOTE]
If the academics list is empty, a blank page will be shown.

[NOTE]
If the wording of the `AcademicsDisplayCommand` contains error(s), an unknown command message will be displayed.

==== Academics Export Command

===== Implementation
The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `AcademicsExportCommand` performs.

*Step 1*. The `AcademicsExportCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which exports the content of Academics
into a csv file in the data folder.
[NOTE]
Format of the command is: `academics export`.

*Step 2.* The command box will be reflected with the `AcademicsExportCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new
`CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

*Step 3.* Subsequently, the `CommandResult` will be processed by the `MainWindow` in the UI component and generate a
studentAcademics.csv in the data folder of the current directory

=== Notes feature
TeaPet application comes with an in-built notes feature, which serves to allow Teachers to record administrative or behavioural
information of his/her students. Each note is tagged to a specific student and acts as a lightweight, digital 'Post It'.

The notes feature comprises of 6 main functionalities represented by 6 commands. They are namely: +

* `NotesCommand` - Displays all notes and help on the notes feature.
* `NotesAddCommand` - Adds a new note into TeaPet.
* `NotesEditCommand` - Edits the details of a note in TeaPet.
* `NotesDeleteCommand` - Deletes a note in TeaPet.
* `NotesFilterCommand` - Filters the list of notes in TeaPet based on user-input keywords.
* `NotesExportCommand` - Exports all notes information into a .csv file

.Class Diagram for Notes Commands
image::developerguide/notes/NotesClassDiagram.png[]

==== Structure of Notes Class
Notes object is made up of 4 fields. They are namely: Student Name, Content, Priority and DateTime. The class diagram below
depicts the structure of the Notes in the Model Component. Please refer to <<Design-Model>> for the higher-level architecture.


.Class Diagram for Notes Model Component
image::developerguide/notes/NotesModelClassDiagram.png[]

==== Add Note
The following is a detailed elaboration of how `NotesAddCommand` operates.

[NOTE]
Format for adding a Note is `notes add name/STUDENT_NAME cont/CONTENT pr/PRIORITY`.
[NOTE]
Priority can only be either LOW, MEDIUM or HIGH, case-insensitive. Student must be present in the class list for him/her to be
tagged in a note.

*Step 1*. The `NotesAddCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which takes in a necessary student name, content and priority as input.

*Step 2*. The note is then searched through the `UniqueStudentList#students` list using the
 `Model#hasStudentName(String student)` method to check if the specified student exists. If the student does not exist, the `CommandException` will be thrown
with the invalid student error message.

*Step 3*. The note is then searched through the `UniqueNotesList#notes` list using the
 `Model#hasNote(Notes note)` method to check if the note already exists. If the note exists, the `CommandException` will be thrown
with the duplicate note error message.

*Step 4*. The method `Model#addNote(Notes note)` will then be called to add the note. The command box will be reflected with
the `NotesAddCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the message.
[NOTE]
If the format or wording of `NotesAddCommand` contains error(s), the behaviour of NotesManager will be similar to step 2 and 3, where either a unknown command
or wrong format error message will be displayed.

==== Edit Note

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `NotesEditCommand` performs.

[NOTE]
Format for adding a Note is `notes edit INDEX [name/UPDATED_STUDENT_NAME] [cont/CONTENT] [pr/PRIORITY]`.
[NOTE]
Priority can only be either LOW, MEDIUM or HIGH, case-insensitive. Enclosing [] braces indicate optional fields.
At least one of the three fields must be present.
[NOTE]
Updated student must be present in the class list for him/her to be tagged in a note.

*Step 1*. The `NotesEditCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which edit attributes of the selected note. The method
checks if the `index` defined when instantiating `NotesEditCommand(Index index, EditNotesDecriptor editNotesDescriptor)` is
valid. Since it is optional for users to input fields, the fields not entered will reuse the existing values that are currently stored and defined
in the `Notes` object.

*Step 2*. The note is then searched through the `UniqueStudentList#students` list using the
 `Model#hasStudentName(String student)` method to check if the specified student exists. If the student does not exist, the `CommandException` will be thrown
with the invalid student error message.

*Step 3*. A new `Notes` with the updated values is created and it is then searched  through the `UniqueNotesList#notes` list using the
 `Model#hasNote(Notes note)` method to check if the note already exists. If the note exists, the `CommandException` will be thrown
with the duplicate note error message.

*Step 4*. The newly created `Notes` will replace the old one through the `Model#setNote(Notes toBeChanged, Notes editedNote`
method.

*Step 5*. The command box will be reflected with the `NotesEditCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the message.


==== Delete Note

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `NotesDeleteCommand` performs.

1. After the successful parsing of user input, the `NotesDeleteCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called which checks if the `index`
is defined as an argument when instantiating the `NotesDeleteCommand(Index index)`  constructor. +
[NOTE]
The `Index` must be within the bounds of the list of notes. +

2. The `Notes` at the specified `Index` is then removed from the `UniqueNotesList#notes` observable list using the
`Model#deleteNote(Index index)` method.

3. The command box will be reflected with the `NotesDeleteCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new `CommandResult` will
be returned with the success message.

.Activity Diagram for Deleting Note
image::developerguide/notes/NotesDeleteActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Filter Notes

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `NotesFilterCommand` performs.

1. After the successful parsing of user input, the `NotesFilterCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called which checks if the
`NotesContainsKeywordsPredicate(keywords)` is defined as part of the argument when instantiating the
`NotesFilterCommand(NotesContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` constructor.

2. The `Notes` objects are then searched through the `UniqueNotesList#notes` list, checking for presence of any keyword given by the user.

3. The existing `UniqueNotesList#internalList` is then cleared and updated using the `Model#updateFilteredNotesList(Predicate predicate)`
method.

4. A new `CommandResult` will be returned with the success message.

==== Export Notes

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `NotesExportCommand` performs.

1. After the successful parsing of user input, the `NotesExportCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

2. The command box will be reflected with the `NotesExportCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new `CommandResult` will
be returned with the success message.

3. The `MainWindow` of the UI component will process the `CommandResult` and create a studentNotes.csv in the data folder of
the current directory.

===== Design Considerations
* *Current Implementation*: Intuitive, simple syntax and user-friendly
- Pros: It is easy for the Teacher to use the feature.
- Cons: Not as powerful and less utility for advanced users.

* *Alternatives Considered*: Many additional fields including special tags, reminders, etc.
- Pros: Powerful, many interesting features that advanced users can use.
- Cons: It contradicts with the initial goal of the Notes feature which is to enable quick and easy note-taking.

=== Personal Schedule feature


The Personal Schedule feature enables teachers to record down their events in their personal scheduler, which
will be sorted accordingly to date and time. Different view modes are available to enable the teachers to easily view their schedule.

This feature is built based on the Jfxtras iCalendarAgenda library. The iCalendarAgenda object is used on the UI side to render VEvents. The VEvent
object takes in data such as event name, start date time, end date time, recurrence of events, etc.

NOTE: VEvent object is used primarily throughout the feature as it is the required object type for the iCalendarAgenda library.
Hence, at the storage level, the Event objects are mapped to VEvents for reading purposes and vice versa for saving purposes.


The Personal Schedule feature allows the user to track and manage their events. The schedule feature consists of eight commands namely:

* `EventDisplayCommand` - Displays all events in the current week.
* `EventAddCommand` - Creates a new event in the scheduler.
* `EventEditCommand` - Edits the details of an event in the scheduler.
* `EventDeleteCommand` - Deletes the specified event from the scheduler.
* `EventIndexCommand` - Obtain the index of the specified event.
* `EventIndexAllCommand` - Obtain all the indexes of all the events in the scheduler.
* `EventViewCommand` - Changes the view mode of the scheduler.
* `EventExportCommand` - Exports the event details into an .ics file.


==== Class Overview
//@@author TheElectricBlender
//tag::class-overview-scheduler[]
The class diagram below shows the structure of Event classes in the `Model`. Notice how the `EventHistory` class depends
on the `Event` class in its constructor but only has a `VEvent` attribute. This is because an `Event` object will always be
mapped to a `VEvent` within the `EventHistory` class. Some methods of `EventHistory` has been omitted for brevity as they are
mostly `VEvent` based, which then again highlights that the interactions with the `Logic` and `UI` components are mostly done
using the `VEvent` type class. Only the `Storage` component works with `Event` type class.

.Class Diagram for Schedule
image::event/schedule_class_diagram.png[]
//end::class-overview-scheduler[]
==== Schedule Display Command

===== Implementation

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `EventDisplayCommand` performs.

NOTE: Format for displaying the schedule is `schedule`.

*Step 1:* The `EventDisplayCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed and it updates the current model using the method
`Model#setEventScheduleLocalDateTime(LocalDateTime localDateTime)`. `LocalDateTime#now()` is used to obtain the current `LocalDateTime`
and used as the parameter in `Model#setEventScheduleLocalDateTime(LocalDateTime localDateTime)`.

*Step 2:* The `EventSchedulePrefs#localDateTime` is then updated with the current `LocalDateTime`.

*Step 3:*  The CommandBox will be reflected with the `EventDisplayCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and
a new CommandResult will be returned with the message.

===== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Product cohesiveness
* *Current Implementation:*
** `schedule`

** Our team chose to use the one-word command `schedule` as the rest of our features also use one-word commands. This is
so that our features look like one integrated product and not an application with several features.

* *Alternatives Considered:*
** `schedule view`

** If this was the implementation that we used, it can get quite confusing to other users as to why the `academics`
command works to change the scene to display the academics whilst to look at the schedule, one must enter in `schedule view`.

//@@author TheElectricBlender
//@@author garysyndromes
//tag::schedule-featureA[]

==== Schedule Add Command


===== Implementation


The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `EventAddCommand` performs.

NOTE: Format for adding an event to the schedule is `schedule add eventName/EVENT_DESCRIPTION startDateTime/YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM
 endDateTime/YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM recur/RECUR_DESCRIPTION color/COLOR_CODE`

WARNING: RECUR_DESCRIPTION can only take the values `none`, `daily` or `weekly`.

WARNING: COLOR_CODE can only take the values `1`-`23`.

*Step 1:* The `EventAddCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called which validates if the `VEvent` object from
the parser is valid.

*Step 2:* The method `Model#addVEvent(VEvent vEvent)` is then called which adds the new `VEvent` to the `EventHistory`.
The `VEvent` is validated to check if it is unique using the `EventUtil#isEqualVEvent(VEvent vEvent)` method.

*Step 3:* If the event is invalid, a `CommandException` will be thrown with an error message.

*Step 4:* The CommandBox will be reflected with the formatted `EventAddCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant with the summary of the `VEvent` and
a new CommandResult will be returned with this same formatted message.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `schedule add` command:

.Activity Diagram for ScheduleAddCommand
image::event/ScheduleAddActivityDiagram.png[]

===== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Command Clarity
* *Current Implementation:*
** `schedule add eventName/Consultation startDateTime/2020-04-08T09:00 endDateTime/2020-04-08T11:00 recur/none color/13`

** We currently have full names for prefixes such as eventName/ instead of name/, as well as slightly lengthier prefixes such as
startDateTime/ and endDateTime/. Although this may be slightly more tedious, we believe that it is clearer as there are other
very similar prefixes in our other features such as name/ and date/.

* *Alternatives Considered:*
** `schedule add name/Consultation startDateTime/2020-04-08T09:00 endDateTime/2020-04-08T11:00 recur/none color/13`

** By doing this, users may be confused as the Academics feature, Student feature and Notes feature require name as a prefix
as well. Furthermore, the name required here is not the name of the student but the name of the event.

//end::schedule-featureA[]



==== Schedule Edit Command

===== Implementation
The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `EventEditCommand` performs.

NOTE: Format for editing an event in the schedule is `schedule edit INDEX [eventName/EVENT_DESCRIPTION] [startDateTime/YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM]
             [endDateTime/YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM] [recur/RECUR_DESCRIPTION] [color/COLOR_CODE]`
NOTE: INDEX is the index of the event. Which can be obtained by the indexGet Command. See <<indexGetCommandSection,below>> for more information.

WARNING: RECUR_DESCRIPTION can only take the values `none`, `daily` or `weekly`.

WARNING: COLOR_CODE can only take the values `1`-`23`.

WARNING: All fields are optional, however at least one field needs to be entered to edit.

*Step 1*: The `EventEditCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which edits the details of the specified
`VEvent` in the model. This method checks if the `index` defined when instantiating
`EventEditCommand(Index index, EditVEventDescriptor editVEventDescriptor)` is valid. This method also checks if
the `editVEventDescriptor` is valid.
Since the fields are optional, the fields not entered by the user will reuse the existing values that are currently stored and defined
in the `VEvent` object.

WARNING: Index must be a positive number greater than zero.

WARNING: At least 1 field of event needs to be provided to `editVEventDescriptor` to edit.

*Step 2*: A new `VEvent` with the newly updated values will be created which replaces the existing `VEvent`
object in the current model using the `Model#setVEvent(Index index, VEvent vEvent);` method. The values input to editVEventDescriptor
are then validated and if the values are not valid, an `IllegalValueException` will be thrown.

*Step 3*: The newly created VEvent is then validated. If the newly created VEvent is the same as any of the events in the scheduler
or it has not been edited, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

*Step 4*: The new created `VEvent` is then mapped to an Event and the `LocalDateTime` of this `VEvent` is used to update
`EventSchedulePrefs#localDateTime` using the method `Model#setEventScheduleLocalDateTime(LocalDateTime localDateTime)`.

*Step 5*: `EventEditCommand#generateSuccessMessage(VEvent vEvent)` formats the success message with
`EventEditCommand#MESSAGE_EDIT_EVENT_SUCCESS` , the `Index` of the event and the `VEvent`.

*Step 6*: The command box will be reflected with the success message and a new
`CommandResult` will be returned with the message.


==== Schedule Delete Command

===== Implementation
The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `EventDeleteCommand` performs.

NOTE: Format for deleting an event in the schedule is `schedule delete INDEX`.

NOTE: INDEX is the index of the event. Which can be obtained by the indexGet Command. See <<indexGetCommandSection,below>> for more information.

*Step 1*: The `EventDeleteCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which deletes the specified
`VEvent` in the model. This method checks if the `targetIndex` defined when instantiating
`EventDeleteCommand(Index targetIndex)` is valid.

WARNING: Index must be a positive number greater than zero and within the bounds of the number of events in the scheduler.

*Step 2*: The `VEvent` at the specified `targetIndex` is then removed from `EventHistory#VEvents`
using the Model#delete(Index index) method.

*Step 3*: `EventDeleteCommand#generateDeleteSuccessMessage(VEvent vEvent)` formats the success message with
`EventDeleteCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` and the `VEvent`.

*Step 4*: The command box will be reflected with the success message and a new
`CommandResult` will be returned with the message.


The following sequence diagram will provide a clearer picture on how the EventDeleteCommand works.

.Sequence Diagram for EventDeleteCommand
image::event/sequence_diagram_event_delete_command.png[]


[[indexGetCommandSection]]
==== Schedule Index Command

===== Implementation
The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `EventIndexCommand` performs.
This command returns the index of the Event(s) with same EVENT_DESCRIPTION as the `eventName` input from the user.
If there are no Events with the same EVENT_DESCRIPTION, the Event with the most similar EVEnT_DESCRIPTION, calculated
using the Levenshtein Distance formula, will then be suggested.

NOTE: Format for getting the index of an event in the schedule is `schedule indexGet/EVENT_DESCRIPTION`.

NOTE: `EVENT_DESCRIPTION` is the name of the event.


*Step 1*: The `EventIndexCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which obtains the index of the specified
`VEvent` in the model. This method first obtains the current list of `Pair` of `Index` and `VEvents` in `EventHistory#vEvents` using
`Model#searchVEvents(String eventName)`.

*Step 2*: The current list of Events is then validated.

* If the list of Events is empty, the method will find the most similar `Event` in
`EventHistory#vEvents` based on the `eventName` entered when when instantiating `EventIndexCommand(String eventName)`. The found `VEvent` is then mapped to an Event and the `LocalDateTime` of this `VEvent` is used to update
`EventSchedulePrefs#localDateTime` using the method `Model#setEventScheduleLocalDateTime(LocalDateTime localDateTime)`. `VEventNotFoundException` is thrown
when there are no events in the schedule at all.
* If the list of Events is not empty, The first `VEvent` of the list of Events is then mapped to an Event and the `LocalDateTime` of this `VEvent` is used to update
`EventSchedulePrefs#localDateTime` using the method `Model#setEventScheduleLocalDateTime(LocalDateTime localDateTime)`.


*Step 3*: `EventIndexCommand#generateSuggestionMessage(Pair<Index, VEvent> resultVEventPair)` or `EventIndexCommand#generateResultMessage(List<Pair<Index, VEvent>> pairVEventIndexList)`
will then format the message according to whether there the list of Events is empty.

* If the list of Events is empty, the method `EventIndexCommand#generateSuggestionMessage(Pair<Index, VEvent> resultVEventPair)` will be called.

* If the list of Events is not empty, the method `EventIndexCommand#generateResultMessage(List<Pair<Index, VEvent>> pairVEventIndexList)` will be called.

*Step 4*: The command box will be reflected with the message and a new
`CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

The following Activity Diagram will provide a clearer picture on how the EventIndexCommand is supposed to run.

.Activity Diagram for EventIndexCommand
image::event/EventIndexCommandActivityDiagram.png[]



==== Schedule IndexAll Command

===== Implementation
The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `EventIndexAllCommand` performs.

NOTE: Format for getting the indexes of all events is `schedule indexAll`.

*Step 1*: The `EventIndexAllCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which obtains all indexes of the all of VEvents in the model.
This method first obtains the current list of `Pair` of `Index` and `VEvents` in `EventHistory#vEvents` using
`Model#getAllVEventsWithIndex()`.

*Step 2*: The current list is then validated. If the list is empty, a new `CommandResult` with message `EventIndexAllCommand#MESSAGE_NO_EVENT`
will be returned.

*Step 3*: The success message is generated using EventIndexAllCommand#generateResultMessage(List<Pair<Index, VEvent>> pairVEventIndexList)
and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with this message.

The following Activity Diagram will provide a clearer picture on how the EventIndexAllCommand is supposed to run.

.Activity Diagram for EventIndexAllCommand
image::event/EventIndexAllActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Schedule View Command

===== Implementation
The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `EventViewCommand` performs.

NOTE: Format for changing the view mode of the schedule is `schedule view mode/SCHEDULE_MODE date/YYYY-MM-DD`.

WARNING: `SCHEDULE_MODE` can only takes the values `daily` or `weekly`. Any other values will result in an error thrown.

WARNING: Date must be entered in YYYY-MM-DD format. Any other values will result in an error thrown.


*Step 1*: The `EventViewCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which changes the view mode of the model.
 This method sets `EventSchedulePrefs#eventScheduleView` and `EventSchedulePrefs#localDateTime`
with `EventViewCommand#scheduleViewMode` and `EventViewCommand#targetViewDateTime` respectively.

*Step 2*: The success message is generated using EventViewCommand#generateSuccessMessage(EventScheduleView eventScheduleViewMode, LocalDateTime targetViewDate)
and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with this message.

The following Activity Diagram will provide a clearer picture on how the EventViewCommand is supposed to run.

.Activity Diagram for EventViewCommand
image::event/EventViewCommandActivityDiagram.png[]


==== Schedule Export Command

===== Implementation
The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `EventExportCommand` performs.

NOTE: Format for exporting the schedule into an .ics file is `schedule export`.

*Step 1*: The `The EventExportCommand#execute(Model model) method is executed which exports the events in the scheduler into a .ics file in the data folder.

*Step 2*: The command box will be reflected with the
EventExportCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS constant and a new CommandResult will be returned with the message.

*Step 3*: Subsequently, the CommandResult will be processed by the`MainWindow` in the UI component and
generate a mySchedule.ics file in the data folder of the current directory.

=== Logging
This section describes how TeaPet record it's logs.

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

In order to add or edit a specific note belonging to a student, the student must first be in the class-list. In order for optimal
manual testing, please create the student first before creating a note which belongs to him/her. You can refer to <<Feature-Add>> to
find out more on how to add a student to the class-list.

[TIP]
Delete all previous notes. Be sure two students named *Freddy Zhang* and *Lee Hui Ting* are in the class-list. Conduct these tests sequentially
from first to last, for the most effective testing experience.

. Adding a note to the notes panel.

.. Test case: `notes add name/Freddy Zhang cont/Reminder to print his testimonial pr/HIGH` +
Expected: New note added to the notes panel. This note should be red (high priority) in colour, belonging to Freddy Zhang. The timestamp
in the note should be the current date and time.

.. Test case: `notes add name/Freddy Zhang cont/Freddy was late for class for the second day in a row. pr/LOW` +
Expected: New note added to the notes panel. This note should be yellow (low priority) in colour, belonging to Freddy Zhang. The timestamp
in the note should be the current date and time.

.. Test case: `notes add name/Lee Hui Ting cont/Hui Ting left school for an interview. pr/MEDIUM` +
Expected: New note added to the notes panel. This note should be orange (medium priority) in colour, belonging to Lee Hui Ting. The timestamp
in the note should be the current date and time.

.. Test case: `notes add name/Freddy_Zhang_ cont/He exemplified an improvement in behaviour pr/LOW` +
   Expected: An error message is shown as the student name should be alpha-numeric.

.. Test case: `notes add name/Freddy Zhang cont/He exemplified an improvement in behaviour pr/Not High` +
   Expected: An error message is shown as priority indicated must be either *LOW*, *MEDIUM* or *HIGH*, case-insensitive.


. Editing a note in the notes panel.

.. Test case: `notes edit 1 cont/Reminder to print his testimonial and gradebook` +
Expected: First note in the panel is updated with new content. Only the content should be modified, and nothing else.

.. Test case: `notes edit 1 name/Lee Hui Ting cont/Reminder to print her testimonial and gradebook` +
Expected: First note in the panel is updated with new name and content. Note should reflect student Lee Hui Ting's name,
with modfied content. Nothing else should be different.


.. Test case: `notes edit 1 pr/MEDIUM` +
Expected: First note in the panel is updated new priority. Note colour should change from red to orange.



. Deleting a note in the notes panel.

.. Test case: `notes delete 1` +
Expected: First note in the panel should be removed.

.. Test case: `notes delete 0` +
Expected: An error message is shown as the integer provided must be greater than zero.

.. Test case: `notes delete 4` +
Expected: An error message is shown as the integer provided as the number of notes in the notes panel is less than 4.
Integer provided is out of range.

. Filtering the list of notes to search for specific notes.

.. Test case: `notes filter Freddy` +
Expected: Only notes containing the word Freddy should be displayed in the notes panel.

.. Test case: `notes filter low` +
Expected: Only notes containing the word low should be displayed in the notes panel.

. Exporting notes in the notes panel into a .csv file.

.. Test case: `notes export` +
Expected: A file named studentNotes.csv should be created in the data folder of the same directory in which TeaPet is installed.

.. Test case: `notes export 3` +
Expected: An error message is shown as there should be no arguments passed into notes export command.

== Effort

*Overview* +
Our team wanted to make an application that could reduce the hassle of managing couriers' orders. We decided to build
Delino which aims to provide a centralised platform for couriers to easily manage their deliveries. Delino is
significantly different from Address Book 3 (AB3). In addition to the existing basic features of AB3, we needed to add
additional features to satisfy the needs of our target audience, couriers. Features that are unique to Delino are
Nearby, Show, Import, Return and the enhanced Search.

*Challenges faced* +

. *Brainstorming of ideas* - Ideation was the first hurdle we faced as a team. Coming up with ideas was easy, however,
the conflict arose when we were deciding on which idea to implement as every member wanted to solve a different problem.
We listed the pros and cons of each proposed idea, and had a few group meetings to evaluate the proposed ideas. We
finally chose an idea that was deemed to be most feasible.
Our team wanted to make an application to create a personal assistant to assist form teachers in their highly
stressful profession. We decided to build
TeaPet to easily manage students and their schedule both inside and outside of classrooms. TeaPet is
significantly different from Address Book 3 (AB3). In addition to the existing basic features of AB3, we had to implement
additional features to satisfy the needs of our target audience, form teachers. Features that are unique to TeaPet are
student particulars, student administration, academics tracking, notes keeping, and a easy to use personal scheduler.

. *Building TeaPet upon AB3* - Initially, our group took a long time understanding the logic of AB3. In addition, converting our
own ideas into code and building upon it on AB3 was very tough. We took a long time familiarising with the the flow of the code, hence resulting
in a slow development of TeaPet initially.


. *Debugging* - Each of us was doing our own individual features, hence when we were merging our pull requests, there are
often merge conflicts. Furthermore, as there are are some inter-dependencies between our features, when one person changes
his or her code, the other party gets affected. Also, when we were doing quality assurance, we spent a long time figuring out
why some of the test cases fail. However, that helped us better understand our code and its expected behaviour, which proved
to be a big help when building TeaPet


. *Building TeaPet upon AB3* - Initially, our group took a long time understanding the logic of AB3. In addition, converting our
own ideas into code and building upon it on AB3 was very tough. We took a long time familiarising with the the flow of the code, hence resulting
in a slow development of TeaPet initially.

. *Documentation* - Initially, it was a challenge to standardise all our format and images in both the user guide and
the developer guide due to different  documentation styles and formats. To tackle this issue, we often skyped for
extended periods of time to go through the documents in detail. More often than not, one of us would share their screen
and we would break down the document line by line. After much hardwork, we were finally able to standardise and
complete our documentation

*Achievements* +

. *Integration of 5 unique features* - The team had set out with the plan to develop TeaPet with 5 unique,
user-centric features. They are namely student particulars, student administration, student academics, notes and
personal scheduler. Throughout the project, we made consistent effort to ensure every feature worked well with one
another, in seamless fashion. There were certain scenarios where the codebase broke due to associations and
dependencies. Despite that, the team manage to ensure all 5 features were well integrated in the final version of
TeaPet, seeking to provide a fantastic user experience.

.  *Maintaining test coverage* – The team had decided to not only ensure our application is well-functioning, but also resistant to bugs. We applied the testing methods taught in the module to write test files for our classes. It is an achievement as despite our large code base, we had managed to achieve our target of 70% test coverage, extensively covering the features.

*Conclusion* +
In conclusion, our team spent great amounts of effort and we are proud to produce TeaPet by working together.
Overall, we believe that TeaPet is a good testament of our hard work and time spent to perfect it.
