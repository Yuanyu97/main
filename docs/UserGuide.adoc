==== Editing an event in schedule: `schedule edit` [Done by Gary Lim]

Edits an event in your personal scheduler.

*Format:* `schedule edit INDEX [eventName/EVENT_DESCRIPTION] [startDateTime/START_DATETIME] [endDateTime/END_DATETIME] [recur/RECUR_DESCRIPTION] [color/COLOR_CODE]`

NOTE: INDEX is the index of the event that you wish to edit. This can be obtained using the indexGet Command. More details <<indexGet,here>>

NOTE: INDEX should be a positive integer and be a valid index.

NOTE: You must edit at least *1* field. The rest of the fields are optional.

NOTE: The format of startDateTime and endDateTime is in YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm format, where time is in the 24-hour format. +
Example: 7th April 2020 10AM will be 2020-04-07T10:00

NOTE: RECUR_DESCRIPTION can only be either of these: `none`, `daily` or `weekly`.

NOTE: Events which are further away in the future have a darker color code. This is intentional.

NOTE: The prefixes are meant to be longer due the the emphasis on clarity as there are other features in this application
which uses similar prefixes as well.

TIP: Use the indexGet/indexAll Command to check the index of the event before you edit to ensure you always correctly edit events.

TIP: COLOR_CODE is from 0 to 23 inclusive. <<colourcode, Refer here for the colour codes>>

{nbsp} +

Example:

*  `schedule edit 2 eventName/Teachers Meeting` +
Edits event with index 2 in the schedule to the new description "Teachers Meeting".

*Expected Outcome:*

        Successfully edited Event 2 into: Event Name: Teachers Meeting , Start DateTime: 2020-04-02T08:00 , End DateTime: 2020-04-07T10:00

TIP: Use the indexGet/indexAll Command to check the index of the event before you delete to ensure you always correctly delete events.

[[indexGet]]

==== Get index of an event in schedule: `schedule indexGet` [Done by Gary Lim]

Get the index of an event in your personal scheduler.

*Format:* `schedule indexGet/EVENT_DESCRIPTION`

NOTE: EVENT_DESCRIPTION is the name of the event. +
 In the unlikely event that you mistype the EVENT_DESCRIPTION, our smart application will
help you find the closest matching event to the EVENT_DESCRIPTION that you entered

NOTE: In the even more unlikely event that you type an EVENT_DESCRIPTION that does not match ANY of the events in the
schedule, the event with index 1 will be shown.

NOTE: Index is used to identify events and help you edit and delete events.

Example:

*  `schedule indexGet/consult` +
Gets the index of the event with the EVENT_DESCRIPTION "consult".

*Expected Outcome:*

    Could not find specified event. This is the closest event we can find based on what you've entered:
    Index: 5 - Event Name: Consultation , Start DateTime: 2020-03-30T08:00 , End DateTime: 2020-03-30T10:00

Example 2 :

*  `schedule indexGet/consultation` +
Gets the index of the event with the EVENT_DESCRIPTION "consultation".

*Expected Outcome:*

    Event found:
    Index: 5 - Event Name: Consultation , Start DateTime: 2020-03-30T08:00 , End DateTime: 2020-03-30T10:00


==== Get all indexes of events in schedule: `schedule indexAll` [Done by Gary Lim]

Get all indexes of your events in your personal scheduler.

*Format:* `schedule indexAll`

NOTE: Index is used to identify events and help you edit and delete events.

Example:

*  `schedule indexAll` +
Gets all indexes of all events currently in your schedule.

*Expected Outcome:*

   These are all the events in your scheduler:
    Index: 1 - Event Name: Consultation , Start DateTime: 2020-03-30T08:00 , End DateTime: 2020-03-30T10:00
    Index: 2 - Event Name: Consultation , Start DateTime: 2020-04-10T08:00 , End DateTime: 2020-04-10T10:00
    Index: 3 - Event Name: Family Dinner , Start DateTime: 2020-03-30T19:00 , End DateTime: 2020-03-30T20:00

==== Change view mode of schedule: `schedule view` [Done by Gary Lim]

Change the view mode of your Personal Schedule as how you need it.

*Format:* `schedule view mode/SCHEDULE_MODE date/YYYY-MM-DD`

NOTE: SCHEDULE_MODE can only be of these: `daily` or `weekly`.

NOTE: Date is in YYYY-MM-DD format.

TIP: Change the view mode to `daily` to help you see all the events you have on that day!

Example:

*  `schedule view mode/daily date/2020-04-12` +
View all the events you have on "12th Apr 2020".

*Expected Outcome:*

    Showing your daily schedule on reference date 2020-04-12

==== Export all events in schedule: `schedule export` [Done by Gary Lim]

Exports all events currently in schedule into a ".ics" file.
The _.ics_ file type can easily be used with Google Calendar and other calendar applications.

*Format:* `schedule export`

NOTE: The file will be exported into the data folder with the file name "mySchedule.ics". Every export command run replaces the existing file.


Example:

*  `schedule export' +
Exports all your events into the data folder with the file name "mySchedule.ics".

*Expected Outcome:*

    Schedule is exported to mySchedule.ics in the data folder

[[update-profile]]
==== Update Profile Picture
TeaPet's student list allows you to upload image of your students into your application.
The following steps will help you upload photos of your students into the student list.

*Step 1*. Locate the image folder. It is in the root directory folder!

.Location of image folder
image::locating_image_folder.png[width="790"]

{nbsp} +

*Step 2*. Open the image folder and drag the image of your student into the folder.

NOTE: The filename of your image must of this format: +
1. Filename of the image must be the same as the student. +
4. File is in .png format. +
For example, a student with name *Simon Lam* must have a image file with name *Simon Lam* in .png format.

TIP: For ideal optimization of the image, its dimensions for its length and width should be roughly equal.

.Dragging png file into image folder
image::images_in_folder.png[width="790"]

{nbsp} +

*Step 3*. Type in the `student` command in the user interface. TeaPet will update the images and
now you can see pictures of your students in your student list!

[WARNING]
Editing the name of the student will change the student image back to the default image. To solve this, you have to edit
the png file in the Image folder as well after you edit the name of the student and then enter the `student` command.

[[FAQ]]
== FAQ [Done by Zhang Yuanyu]
This section will provide answers to all Frequently Asked Questions by our users.
[qanda]
How do I transfer my data to another Computer? ::
Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TeaPet folder.

How do I transfer the information in TeaPet to the co-form teacher? ::
Right now, TeaPet does not support the transfer of data, but the feature will be coming soon in the near future!

Why can't I see my personal schedule from a while back? ::
To see the schedule for a specific week, you could use the command `schedule view mode/weekly date/DATE`, where date is
one of the date in the week you are seeking for.

How do I retrieve back all the class list in TeaPet if I accidentally cleared all the content? ::
Right now TeaPet does not support a backup feature, hence it would be best if you do not accidentally use the clear
command. The backup feature will be coming soon in the near future!

TeaPet is not working on my computer. How do I fix it? ::
Ensure that your computer is running on Java 11 and not other versions. TeaPet does not support other versions of Java.

Sometimes the text size of TeaPet is too small. How do I fix it? ::
TeaPet runs best on full screen mode. Hence, it is strongly encouraged that you maximise the screen when using TeaPet for clarity.

Sometimes I forget the various commands to use, where can I find the list of commands? ::
You could view enter help tab by clicking F1, or by pressing the `help` button in the tabs section located at the top of TeaPet,
which will then lead you to this user guide to provide you with the help you need!
